            <h2>Site Name</h2>
            <p><strong>M&amp;K Laundry Services</strong></p>
            <p>
                I chose this name because it clearly represents the business focus on professional Laundry
                services, while also being simple and easy to remember. The "M&amp;K" adds a presonal
                branding touch.

            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <p>
                The primary audience for M&amp;K Laundry Services includes busy professionals,
                students, and families in urban areas who need reliable and affordable laundry care.
                They value convenience, time-saving solutions, and professional results. Many of them may
                not have the time or equipment to handle laundry themselves, so they look for services that
                offer pickup, delivery, and flexible scheduling.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, institutions such as churches, schools, hotels, hospitals, and corporate offices are
                also part of our target audience. These organizations require bulk laundry services on a regular
                basis and value efficiency, consistency, and professional quality to meet their operational needs.
